I'll create a simplified business flow for an Inventory Management System with these core services.

**Core Business Flow**:
1. Users authenticate and get authorized for specific actions
2. Products are managed in a catalog
3. Orders are created and affect inventory
4. Inventory tracks stock levels

**Service Breakdown**:

1. **User Service** (Authentication & Authorization)
- Login/Register users
- Generate JWT tokens
- Manage user roles (ADMIN, MANAGER, STAFF)
```json
POST /api/auth/authenticate
{
    "username": "john",
    "password": "password123"
}

Response:
{
    "token": "jwt_token_here",
    "role": "MANAGER"
}
```

2. **Product Service** (Product Catalog)
- Manage product information
- Pricing
- Basic product details
```json
POST /api/products
{
    "name": "Laptop Dell XPS",
    "sku": "DELL-XPS-15",
    "price": 1299.99,
    "description": "15-inch laptop"
}

GET /api/products/categories
GET /api/products?category=electronics
```

3. **Inventory Service** (Stock Management)
- Track stock levels
- Handle stock movements
- Low stock alerts
```json
GET /api/inventory/product/{productId}
Response:
{
    "productId": "123",
    "quantity": 50,
    "reorderLevel": 10,
    "lastUpdated": "2024-02-03T10:30:00"
}

POST /api/inventory/movement
{
    "productId": "123",
    "quantity": 10,
    "type": "STOCK_IN"
}
```

4. **Order Service** (Order Processing)
- Create orders
- Track order status
- Order history
```json
POST /api/orders
{
    "customerId": "C123",
    "items": [
        {
            "productId": "P123",
            "quantity": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

**Common Business Scenarios**:

1. **Creating an Order**:
```text
Client -> Order Service
   1. Verify user token
   2. Check product availability (calls Inventory Service)
   3. Create order
   4. Update inventory (publishes event)
   5. Return order confirmation
```

2. **Stock Movement**:
```text
Staff -> Inventory Service
   1. Verify staff permissions
   2. Record stock movement
   3. Update stock levels
   4. Trigger alerts if stock low
```

3. **Product Updates**:
```text
Admin -> Product Service
   1. Verify admin permissions
   2. Update product details
   3. Notify inventory service
```

Would you like me to provide the implementation details for any of these flows or show more business scenarios?
