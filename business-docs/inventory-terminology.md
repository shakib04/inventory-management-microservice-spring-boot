Let me explain each field in the inventory management context:

1. `reorderLevel` (Minimum Stock Level):
- The minimum quantity of an item that should be maintained in stock
- When stock falls below this level, it triggers a reorder
- Example: If reorderLevel is 10 for laptops, and stock reaches 9, it's time to order more

2. `reorderQuantity` (Order Quantity):
- The recommended quantity to order when stock needs replenishing
- Usually calculated based on demand and lead time
- Example: When laptops need reordering, order 50 units

3. `lastRestockDate`:
- Timestamp of when the item was last restocked
- Records when new inventory was received
- Example: When you receive 100 new laptops, this date is updated

4. `lastCountDate`:
- Timestamp of the last physical inventory count
- Used for inventory reconciliation and auditing
- Example: When staff physically counts stock to verify system numbers

Example scenario:
```java
InventoryItem laptop = new InventoryItem();
laptop.setProductId("LAPTOP-001");
laptop.setQuantity(15);        // Current stock
laptop.setReorderLevel(20);    // Alert when stock < 20
laptop.setReorderQuantity(50); // Order 50 when restocking
laptop.setLastRestockDate(LocalDateTime.now()); // Just received stock
laptop.setLastCountDate(LocalDateTime.now());   // Just counted
```

When stock drops below reorderLevel, system should alert to order reorderQuantity more units.
